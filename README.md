A twist on dating websites in the era of online dating.Relicious allows users to match themselves with other users by restaurants they like.

Some of its key features are:

-Private messaging between matched users.
-Restaurant search page that returned venues by terms you searched(Food types, restaurant name etc).These results were obtained through Foursquare's API.
-User authentication/encrypted passwords through the gem Devise.
-User's had the option to upload images to have a profile pic.We passed the attachments through our servers validation before sending it to a AWS s3 bucket where they're hosted.
